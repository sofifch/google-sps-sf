      <p class="intro">I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. I moved to Atlanta for college at Georgia 
          Tech, where I am pursuing my Bachelors in CS, with a concentration in Intelligence and 
          Devices.</p>
      <p class="intro">Among my favorite extracurriculars you can find volleyball and swimming for 
          sports, playing the piano and dancing for the arts, and speaking French for the languages.</p>
      <p class="intro">I am very involved in my SHPE Chapter and Familia, where I currently serve 
          as Internal Vicepresident, managing recruitment, retention and cohesion among its members. 
          I also enjoy my Resident Advisor work on campus, where I assist Freshmen with their college 
          transition.</p>
      <p class="intro">Due to my origins, I have acquired a very global perspective, so I very much 
          value individual aptitudes that add up to the collective interest. I regard myself as very 
          resilient and committed, and look forward to opportunities like this program to put my 
          technological preparation into practice. Hands on!</p>

                <p class="project-dsc">In a team of 3 (with my friends Andrea and Gabriela),  
                    we performed a 2-year investigation to determine the essential functions of an 
                    incubator. Then, we designed a prototype that implemented the vital functions 
                    using materials accessible for low-resource populations. After performing 
                    functionality validation tests, we donated several prototypes to foundations

                    cash flow issues they were experiencing in the company. I personally provided 
                    assistance on improving the UI features of the software they developed, like

                    a individual player trading game, where resources and money gave you power, 
                    and there were varied NPC encounters that interacted with the player and made 
                    it more dynamic.</p>

                    enjoy taking pictures, specifically of food. I actually enjoy it so much that I 
                    can’t ever start eating before taking a snapshot of it first. People usually 
                    complain, but I always remind them that the camera eats first! Until now, I 
                    had  never thought about why I do it, but now I realize that there are mainly 
                    2 motives behind it.</p>

                <p class="food-talk">The first one is that I am very oddly satisfied by a well-thought 
                    out plate presentation, and the way they’re placed in a manner appealing to the 
                    consumer, in this case, me! Here I share with you 3 examples of food-shots that 
                    I took. The top right portrays a typical breakfast in my home country: an 
                    “arepa” with multiple sides, scrambled eggs, cheese, ham, and of course, some 
                    shredded beef and a touch of black beans. To the left, it’s a meal for a beach 
                    day: fried fish, rice and some fresh salad. Below, I bet you know it: 
                    mini-burgers and french fries!</p>

                <p class="food-talk">The other purpose, well, it’s just a matter of initializing 
                    small talk with friends. Sometimes you’re trying with all your efforts to 
                    maintain a healthy diet and sharing what you eat with others on the same plan 
                    as it makes you feel supported and gives you more motivation. Occasionally, 
                    you feel like cooking famous recipes from scratch and by your own, so why not 
                    share it? I am the kind of person that cuts the chocolate lava-cake in half 
                    just to record it so be prepared!</p>

                <p class="tap-subtitles">WELL-ROUNDED ACADEMY</p>
                <p class="tap-dsc">Long story short, I used to take dance classes at an academy 
                    that was very popular for its Jazz lessons, but they asked every member to 
                    learn 4 distinct types of dances: Jazz, Ballet, Flamenco, and Tap. They were 
                    very enthusiastic about the well-rounded dancer. That’s where I discovered my 
                    passion for Tap! It was an activity that I hadn’t done before, following the 
                    rhythm of music by making distinct sounds with my feet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column" style="width:280px">

                <p class="tap-subtitles">MINDFULNESS</p>
                <p class="tap-dsc">The name comes from the metal “tap” that the shoe has on the 
                    toe and the heel. Tapping those against the floor is what makes the 
                    percussion-like sound that develops the whole heart of the dance. I found 
                    myself anticipating the Tap class. It effortlessly granted me a space where 
                    I felt completely comfortable of being myself and coordinating my mind and 
                    body, which is why I practiced it for 7 years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column" style="width:280px">

                <p class="tap-subtitles">ATYPICAL</p>
                <p class="tap-dsc">I also regard it as a very special acquired skill, since not 
                    many people find it appealing or even manageable. It has a couple of movements 
                    like the “brush” or the “shuffle” which require a lot of motor coordination and 
                    awareness of the desired sound. The incredible thing about it is that if you’re 
                    suficiently familiar with the moves, you can dance along almost any kind of music… 
                    classic, hip-hop, country, you name it!</p>

                    younger. I encourage you to watch it various times and try to learn it, it 
                    doesn’t matter if you don’t have the shoes, I promise it will still be really 
                    fun!</p>
